# AI Task Reminder

A simple **Python Flask web app** that allows users to:

- Login using their email  
- Add tasks with a date and time  
- Receive **email reminders** when the task time comes  

This project demonstrates a basic **AI agent behavior** — it autonomously reminds the user about their tasks.
